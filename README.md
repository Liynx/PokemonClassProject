# PokemonClassProject
Project to make a simple predefined pokemon game using PHP.

-The code will plot markers on a google map using the maps API for a trainer and several "Wild Pokemon".
-The user can then click a button to proceed and the trainer will move to the closest wild Pokemon.

-During battle the pokemon will take turns attacking each other using their attack power against the opposing HP.

-The process will continue until either the trainers Pokemon have all lost or all of the wild Pokemon have been defeated.
